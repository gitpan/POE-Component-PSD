# README: Getting started with the Persistent Session Daemon web server
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can run a demo server right from this temporary distribution area.

.  On systems that allow symbolic file links, create a link in
   this 'demo' subdirectory as follows.
     
      ln -s ../lib lib

   On all other systems, copy the entire contents of the lib 
   subdirectory into this 'demo' directory.

      copy ../lib .           # or whatever file copy you use

.  Generate a set of server certificate files
      bin/buildCert.pl 
      bin/buildCert.pl -h     # for notes on all the prompts

.  Make some quick edits to the PSD configuration data file.
   The configuration file is located under this directory. 

      conf/psd_min.conf

   Set values for the following directives. The ServerRoot
   must be the full path down to the 'demo' subdirectory
   where this README file resides.

      Directive   Examples
      ----------- ----------------------
      ServerRoot  /full/path/to/demo
      Listen      ip.address:19665
      ServerName  hostname.domain:19665
      User        uname
      Group       gname

.  Start the PSD server daemon process. To skip the 'session
   detach' step of the daemon and watch connections on your
   terminal, run the server with the "-D" switch (--Debug).

      bin/psdServer.pl
      bin/psdServer.pl  -D 5     # to skip session detach 

.  Try connecting to the PSD Web server using your browser.
   You will be prompted to accept an SSL certificate (so
   remember to use "https://" and not "http://"). Use the
   same port number you added to the configuration file.

      https://your.server.whatever:19665/session/

.  If you ran the PSD server as a daemon, you can gracefully
   shutdown the process using the 'psdServer.pl' command.

      psdServer.pl -shutdown

.  If you see a Web page with a link to start a session,
   and that link actually starts a session, then it works!

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The next step is optional. If you want to configure an Apache Web
server to proxy certain requests to your PSD server, see notes in
the Apache2::UriProxy class, included with this distribution.

There are at least three ways to accomplish this proxy setup,
so pick the one that you are most comfortable using.

   o  you can add Apache2::UriProxy into your Apache server

   o  you can use mod_proxy directives instead, or

   o  you can use mod_rewrite directives

Each of these alternatives is explained in Apache2::UriProxy.

This setup will require the following Apache modules. At a
minimum, you will need to have SSL access to your Apache
server before you try configuring it for proxy to the PSD.

   o  mod_ssl       - required
   o  mod_proxy     - required
   o  mod_rewrite   - optional
